Task:

- Parse legalruleml into some form of ast
- Populate an object model
- Query/operate on the object model

Object model:

We do not want a DOM; if we wanted that, we could just use libxml2 or similar with a validation pass with an xsd. Also, DOMs are pretty terrible to actually program against.

Defeasible logic is in a large sense firstorderizable, so we could write an encoding into SQL form. Then quesries, alterations etc could just use SQL, and we could use a db connection for FFI.
